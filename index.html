                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>My name is Sophie, but I am known as Nhi in Vietnamese. My family is from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam">Vietnam</a>, a small country in Southeast Asia, and I came to Calgary when I was 14 years old. The rich culture, landscapes, and warm people of Vietnam have left a lasting impression on me. Currently, I'm a student at the <a href="https://www.sait.ca/">Southern Alberta Institute of Technology</a> (SAIT). My focus is on User Experience in the Interactive Design program. I have been drawn to this field because it combines my love of creativity and technology.</p>
